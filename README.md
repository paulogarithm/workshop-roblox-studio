See this little bar ? This is how much you'vee learned about
the basics of roblox studio !

But first, you will have to set the things up:
1. Have a Windows Boot
2. Install Roblox & Roblox Studio

If you're using Linux and don't have windows, please follow
[this tutorial](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-ultimate-guide-on-how-to-play-roblox-on-linux/3171920)
to install roblox studio.

Now, you should be able to create a game after launching Roblox
Studio, so please create once.

Now that you created your game, it should look like the image here at the bottom left.

As you can see, you have serveral windows that shows up, here are the ones
on this screenshot:
- the **explorer** at the left, that allows you to manage your instances
- the **properties** on the top right, that allows you to change some
properties of an instance (size, color, name...)
- the **output** on the bottom right, that shows the results of `print` &
`warn` functions, as long as the errors if you encounter any.
- at the center, you have your **workspace**, which is basically what your
game is going to look like.
